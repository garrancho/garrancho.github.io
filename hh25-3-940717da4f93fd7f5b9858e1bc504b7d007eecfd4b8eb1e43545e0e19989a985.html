        <label for="pumpkin-count">Sheldon and Leonard are in London for a science conference, but Sheldon has heard a strange rumour. On Leinster Gardens in Bayswater, there are two “houses” that are not real at all. Thse "Schrödinger Houses" trigger Sheldon's curiosity. However, they are only façades, hiding the railway tunnels of the old Underground line behind them. What are house numbers? Pick the smallest and don't forget to take a picture.</label>

        <legend>⌛️ Time flies</legend>
        <span>While the boys chase “scientific secrets” across London, Penny, Amy and Bernadette decide to enjoy a calm walk in Kensington Gardens. They stop at the Time Flies monument, a clock tower near the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Playground. The clock has four faces, each looking in a different direction.

Amy becomes convinced that the four sides symbolise four parallel timelines, all depending on whether Sheldon annoyed her before breakfast. Penny just wants a nice photo. Bernadette wonders if she can use the clock to measure how long it takes Howard to get lost. How many arches in the monument? Don't forget to take a picture.

        <legend>⛪︎ 🇬🇷</legend>
        <label for="caretaker-name">Sheldon discovers that Saint Sophia Cathedral on Moscow Road is not only close to Bayswater, but also a masterpiece of Byzantine-style architecture with a deep scientific connection to geometry and ancient design. Amy is thrilled at the idea of examining the structure through the lens of classical Greek maths. Howard claims he can identify the load-bearing arches on sight, while Raj is convinced the cathedral has perfect acoustics for his favourite musical dramas.Penny, meanwhile, is mostly hoping someone will point out a good café nearby. Sheldon insists this visit is essential to understanding the “cultural wavefunction” of London. When was the Saint Sophia Cathedral consecrated? Ensure you take a picture.</label>
